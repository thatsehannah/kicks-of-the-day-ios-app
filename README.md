# Kicks Of The Day (KOTD) app
Formerly known as the "The Sneaker Game"

- This is digital sneaker collection app tailored to suggest footwear choices based on real-time local weather conditions
- Pioneering an intuitive user interface using SwiftUI
- Sneaker data will be retrieved from a third-party sneaker database (https://thesneakerdatabase.com/)
- I'm incorporated the Open Weather API to fetch accurate, real-time weather data so the app can effectively select the appropriate shoes
- Using Firebase right now to facilitate secure data storage, retrieval, and real-time updates
- In a future update, I plan to integrate social sharing features and user profiles for a community-driven experience
